# Introcuding d3

d3, *Data-Driven Documents*, is a JavaScript library for creating data visualizations. The *data* is provided by you, and the *documents* are web-based documents, meaning anything that can be rendered by a web browser, such as HTML and SVG. D3 does the *driving*, in the sense that it connects the data to the documents.  

## What It Does

Fundamentally, D3 is an elegant piece of software that facilitates generation and manipulation of web documents wiht data. It does this by:

* *Loading* data into the browser's memory
* *Binding* data to elements within the document, creating new elements as needed
* *Transforming* those elements by interpreting each element's bound datum and settings its visual properties accordingly
* *Transitioning* elements between states in response to user input

Learning to use d3 is simply a process of learning its syntax, so you can tell it how to load and bind data, and transform and transition elements.

The *transformation* step is most important, as this is where the *mapping* happens.
